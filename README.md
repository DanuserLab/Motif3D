### Software for 3D Morphological Motif Detection
##### May 23, 2019

This suite of software was designed to detect morphological motifs, such as blebs, filopodia, and lamellipodia, from 3D images of surfaces, particularly images of cell surfaces.

It is associated with the paper, [***Robust and automated detection of subcellular morphological motifs in 3D microscopy images***](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-019-0539-z), written by Meghan K. Driscoll, Erik S. Welf, Andrew R. Jamieson, Kevin M. Dean, Tadamoto Isogai, Reto Fiolka, and [Gaudenz Danuser](https://www.danuserlab-utsw.org/).
